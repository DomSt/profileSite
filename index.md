Well, hello there.

I’m Dom, a digital product designer living and working in nuremberg, germany.

I love to create products that help people getting stuff done.
If you want, you can read a bit more [about me and my way to work](/about/).

You can also have a look at some of my work on
[Codepen](http://codepen.io/DomST/), {% include /icons/github.html username="DomSt" %} or [GitHub](https://github.com/DomSt).

{% include teaser.html %}

So, if there any questions left, or you just want to say hello, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DStoecklein) or send me an [email](mailto:dominik.stoecklein@gmail.com).

I’d love to hear from you.
