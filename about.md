From a young age I’ve been fascinated with computers and software. I first came into contact with coding when I was 14 and started using basic HTML and CSS to make really really simple table based websites. I also tried to learn C++ back then but that didn’t really work.  

Later (much much later) I began studying media design and worked as a freelancer on the side. Since I had the feeling that I am learning much more working on real projects I dropped out and became a full-time freelancer.

Since then I worked for a number of clients, ranging from fashion firms over banking companies to advertising agencies. In {YEAR} I took on my first permanent position as a Art Director Digital / Concept at Publicis Modem (now Publicis Pixelpark) {LINK}.
In {YEAR} I finally left the advertising business and joined germany’s leading sports magazine as a digital product designer.

Nowadays I enjoy most working on productivity tools like content management systems or database GUIs.

## Toolbox

### Tools I use quite regularly:

- Atom (atom.io) - My main text editor which recently replaced sublime text
- Codepen (codepen.io)  - for quick code sketches
- Photoshop / Sketch / Illustrator - Sometimes I just have to mock up some layouts I don’t want to use code for or need to make icons and so on
- Dropbox - For easy file sharing / syncing
- Evernote - To take notes… all the paper notes tend to get confusing
- Oh and occasionally my brain ;)


## Process

I prefer an user-centered and object-oriented ux approach to designing products or features. (Oh all these buzzwords… sorry). So I want to know who my users are, what do they want to do, and what data / content do I have to work with?
For the visual design part I really recommend using design systems and pattern libraries, since they really help with keeping things consistent.
When working on personal projects I mostly use a mix of SMACSS, ITCSS and BEM for my code. For company projects I use the defined coding styleguide, of course.
